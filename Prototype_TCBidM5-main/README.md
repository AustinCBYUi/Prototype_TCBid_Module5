# Prototype_TCBidM5
Prototype Termite Bid Program. The pricing sheet is property of Rollins.

# Overview

This application is a prototype of the treatment price calculator, instead
of manually calculating numbers and potentially wasting time at a prospect's
home, you can quickly retrieve a price to present to the customer!

The software is a UI based, simple calculator that takes the linear footage of
a home, the construction type and desired treatment type, and calculates the
initial cost of a job and what the warranty will look like.

The purpose for writing this software is to demo how I plan to layout a fully
functional version of this into my application at a later date, and to experiment
with implementing with JSON data as references.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

Nothing directly for the Rust demo, but it will be put into my CMS as:

- Re-implement the termite bid calculator, including a break-down of other job types for a wider spectrum of pricing and options for the customer.
- Add options for quoting general pest control as well, Insulation, pre-treatments, exclusions, etc...
- Implement a way to directly attach the results to an email for prospects.
